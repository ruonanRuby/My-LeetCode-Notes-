##  Question 1064.Fixed Point
	Description: Find the SMALLEST index in which A[i] == i

	My Solution: check the array not-exist situation then iterate the array 
	from 0 to (length - 1 ) to find the first index matches the requirement.
	
	Time Complexity: O(n);
	Space Complexity: O(1);
 	
## Question 832 Flipping an Image 
	Description: flip the row of binary matrix A then invert it 

	My Solution: Iterative row.length / 2 to flip and inver the node value 

	Time Complexity: O(N) <the size of binary matrix>
	Space Complexity: O(N)
